# vim-conf
Just a little repository to contain my vim configuration, and an install script to set it up.

# Installing #
Clone the repository anywhere on your machine:  

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/andrewtcymmer/env-conf ~/env-conf

On \*nix systems, run `install.sh`. If any of your dotfiles already exist, back them up and delete them from your home directory before running the script.
