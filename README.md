# env-conf
Just a little repository to contain my development environment configuration.  

# Installing #
Clone the repository to `$HOME/env-conf`:  

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/andrewtcymmer/env-conf ~/env-conf

On \*nix systems, run `install.sh`. If any of your dotfiles already exist, back them up and delete them from your home directory before running the script.
